                <p>I am a musician, producer, and lover of technology. I love to play guitar, piano and any other
                    instrument
                    I can
                    get my hands on. I love to write, produce and record my own music as well. You can listen to <a
                        href="https://soundcloud.com/user-898436493-234175409"><strong>my music</strong></a> by clicking on the preceding
                    link. I
                    also love animals and outdoor
                    activities.

    Whenever I'm not doing something tech related, working on music or sleeping; you can usually find me outside
    looking for an adventure with my dogs. <br>I graduated with my bachelor of science in management information systems (MIS)
    from Utah State University in December of 2019. The blend between business and technology that I was able to learn
    about through this
    curriculum
    has proven to be extemely valuable. I currently live in Utah and plan to move
    to
    the Pacific Northwest, find a good job at a good company, and eventually buy a house where I can settle down and
    continue to improve my music and
    tech skills :) Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn! <a
